## create-electron-app

Create Electron App allows you to quickly bootstrap a new Electron app, using Electron Forge.

### Usage

Initialize a new project by running the following:

```
// yarn 1
yarn create electron-app my-app

// npm
npx create-electron-app@latest my-app
```

You should now have a directory called my-app with an ultra-minimal Electron app boilerplate inside. If you head into that directory and start up the app, you'll be all set to start developing!

```
// yarn 1
cd my-app
yarn start

// npm
cd my-app
npm start
```
